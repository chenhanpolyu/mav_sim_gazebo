# mav_sim_gazebo
### Introduction
<img src="others/mavsim.png" width="400">

This Kit provides an end to end simulation solution for MAV visual SLAM and path planning researches. <br />
In this work, several features are added to the default [PX4](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware) Gazebo Simulator: <br />
-A realsense D435 model (based on [realsense_gazebo_plugin](https://github.com/pal-robotics/realsense_gazebo_plugin)) <br />
-Modified IRIS MAV model <br />
-Several structured/unstructured simulation world <br />
-Keyborad control support <br />
The work has been verified on Ubuntu 18.04 + ROS melodic environment <br />
We strongly recommend to you to run this simulation with CUDA supported graphic card!

### Usage
Follow the px4's [ROS with Gazebo Simulation](https://dev.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/simulation/ros_interface.html) tutorial and setup basic gazebo environment accordingly<br />
Install pre-required packages
````
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mavlink/mavros/master/mavros/scripts/install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
sudo bash ./install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-mavros ros-melodic-mavros-extras ros-melodic-mavros-msgs libncurses5-dev 
````
Clone this repository to catkin src folder say: ~/catkin_ws/src
````
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/Ttoto/mav_sim_gazebo.git
````
Compile
````
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
````
Run the simulator
````
roscd mav_sim_gazebo
./sim.sh
````
If your work space in not "catkin_ws" or your PX4 Firmware is not located at "src/Firmware" you should edit the following line in the sim.sh script :
````
cd ~/src/Firmware
export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=$GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH:~/catkin_ws/src/mav_sim_gazebo/gazebo
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:~/catkin_ws/src/mav_sim_gazebo/gazebo/models
export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH:~/catkin_ws/devel/lib
````
to
````
cd PX4_Firmware_PATH
export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=$GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH:~/YOUR_WORK_SPACE/src/mav_sim_gazebo/gazebo
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:~/YOUR_WORK_SPACE/src/mav_sim_gazebo/gazebo/models
export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH:~/YOUR_WORK_SPACE/devel/lib
````
Please pay attention, if you HAVE ANY OTHER GAZEBO_* PATH in your ~/.bashrc file before, please comment(delete) them in advance, or the paths may collide and gazebo may crash once you spawn the UAV model in the simulation world.

Using keyboard to control the MAV in simulator
````
roslaunch mav_sim_gazebo keyboard_ctr.launch
````

### Running End-To-End simulation
You can use the FLVIS-glmapping-FUXI(localization-mapping-planning kits) navigation system. <br />
The first step is to install [FLVIS](https://github.com/HKPolyU-UAV/FLVIS), [glmapping](https://github.com/HKPolyU-UAV/glmapping) and [FUXI](https://github.com/chenhanpolyu/fuxi-planner) accordinly. <br />
Then start the simulator localization mapping and planning kit in sequence. <br />
````
roscd mav_sim_gazebo
./sim.sh
roslaunch mav_sim_gazebo flvis.launch
roslaunch mav_sim_gazebo glmapping.launch
roslaunch mav_sim_gazebo fuxi.launch
````
You can use the 2D-Nav-Goal in RVIZ to publish your destination. <br />
